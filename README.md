# 🐾 Dog Breeds - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains my second EDA project, where I explored a dataset of various dog breeds. The goal was to uncover patterns, trends, and insights using Python and popular data science libraries.

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset includes details of dog breeds such as:
- Breed group
- Height and weight
- Life expectancy
- Temperament traits (e.g., friendliness, trainability, barking level)
- Country of origin

It’s a great dataset for practicing exploratory data analysis with a focus on both numerical and categorical variables.

## 🧪 Objectives

This project focuses on:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Basic statistical analysis
- Grouping and aggregation
- Advanced filtering and sorting
- Data visualization for better insights

## 🔍 Key Questions Explored

1. **Basic Exploration**
   - Number of unique breed groups and sizes
   - Average lifespan of all breeds

2. **Grouping & Aggregation**
   - Which breed group is the most friendly?
   - Average energy levels by breed size
   - Countries with the most number of breeds

3. **Sorting & Filtering**
   - Top 3 breeds with the longest lifespan
   - Breeds with high trainability and low shedding

4. **Visualizations**
   - Bar charts, heatmaps, scatter plots, and boxplots
   - Trait comparison across breed groups and sizes

5. **Feature Engineering**
   - Custom scoring metrics like `family_friendly_score` and `total_score`
   - Correlation between traits and lifespan

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Sample Visuals

- 📈 Bar chart: Average lifespan by breed group  
- 🔥 Heatmap: Correlation among temperament traits  
- 🐕 Boxplot: Barking level vs. Breed size  
- 🎯 Scatterplot: Trainability vs Energy (by size)


## 🚀 Results & Insights

- Certain breed groups tend to live longer and be more trainable.
- Small-sized breeds generally bark more than larger breeds.
- Friendly and low-shedding breeds are often preferred for families.
- A custom scoring method can help identify well-rounded breeds.
